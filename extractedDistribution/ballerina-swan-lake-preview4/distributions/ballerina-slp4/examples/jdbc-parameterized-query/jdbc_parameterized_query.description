// This example demonstrates how to use the `sql:ParameterizedQuery` to easily
// create pre-compiled SQL statements that can be reused. Note that the 
// relevant database driver JAR should be placed in the `BALLERINA_HOME/bre/lib` 
// folder. However, this sample is based on an H2 database and the H2 database 
// driver JAR is included by default into the Ballerina distribution. 
// Therefore, it is not required to copy the driver JAR for H2 databases.<br><br>
// For more information on the underlying module,
// see the [JDBC module](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/api-docs/ballerina/java.jdbc/index.html).
