// Adding the `table` keyword with a key specifier as a prefix to a `query expression` allows users
// to create a `table` from the query expression.
// The first clause must be the `table key([key/s]) from` clause and must consist of a `select` clause as well.
// Each emitted value from the `select` clause is added as a new member to construct the resultant `table`.
// With a keyed `table`, the `on conflict` clause can be used to handle key conflicts when the `select` clause
// emits the rows.
