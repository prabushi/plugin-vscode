// Fields of a class or an object constructor expression can be marked as `final`. Values can be set for such fields
// either using initializer expressions (default values) or in the `init` method. A value cannot be set for such a
// field once the object is created.<br/>
// If all the fields are `final` fields and the type of each field is a subtype of `readonly`, the object value is
// constructed as an immutable value, which will belong to `readonly`.<br/>
// Whether a field is `final` is not part of the type and it does not affect subtyping.
