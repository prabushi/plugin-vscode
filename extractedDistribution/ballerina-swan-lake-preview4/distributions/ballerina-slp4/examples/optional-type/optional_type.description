// One of the design principles of the type system of Ballerina is to eliminate null reference errors.
// Over the years, null reference errors have caused numerous system crashes, security vulnerabilities etc.
// The use of optional types `T?` is simply a shortcut for representing `T|()`, where it says that the 
// value of this type is either `T` or `()` (nil).
