// Type references in a class or object provide a way to copy the members from a class or object
// into another class or object. It is equivalent to declaring the members explicitly
// within the new class, thus, eliminating redundancy. A class/object can have
// zero or more type references and may have chained references as well.
// Fields and method definitions can override referenced fields and methods
// provided that they are sub-types of referenced field/method types.
