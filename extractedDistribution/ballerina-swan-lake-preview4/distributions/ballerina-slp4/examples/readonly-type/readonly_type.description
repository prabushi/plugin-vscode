// The `readonly` type consists of values whose read-only bit is set.
// `()`, `boolean`, `int`, `float`, `decimal`, `string`, `error`, `function`, `service`, and `typedesc` are
// considered to be inherently immutable basic types, and a value belonging to an inherently immutable basic type
// will always have its read-only bit set, and thus will always belong to the `readonly` type.
// XML, lists, mappings, tables, and objects are selectively immutable types, where values belonging to such types
// are immutable and belong to the `readonly` type only if their read-only bit is set.
// A `readonly` value is deeply immutable, and guarantees that members, if any, are also immutable.
